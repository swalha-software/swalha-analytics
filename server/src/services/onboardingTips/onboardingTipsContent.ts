    body: `Thanks for signing up for Swalha Analytics. Your account is set up with analytics that respect your visitors' privacy.

Unlike traditional analytics tools, Swalha Analytics doesn't use cookies, doesn't track users across websites, and doesn't sell your data to advertisers. Your visitors stay anonymous, and you still get the insights you need.

Privacy shouldn't mean giving up on understanding your audience.

If you're curious how it compares to other tools, the docs have a side-by-side comparison.`,

    subject: "Why your metrics might look different than GA",
    body: `If you've been using Google Analytics before, you might notice your Swalha Analytics numbers look different. That's actually a good thing.

Adblockers commonly block Google Analytics. Lightweight, privacy-focused analytics is blocked far less often, so you're probably seeing closer to your real traffic - and it's likely higher than GA ever showed you.

Those missing visitors in GA? They were always there. You just couldn't see them.`,

    subject: "Track what matters with custom events",
    body: `Pageviews tell you what pages people visit. Custom events tell you what they actually do.

Track button clicks, form submissions, video plays - anything that matters to your business. It's one line of code:

window.rybbit.event("signup_clicked")

Or use data attributes directly in your HTML:

<button data-rybbit-event="signup_clicked">Sign Up</button>

Events show up in your dashboard and can be used as funnel steps or goal triggers.`,

    body: `Raw traffic numbers are interesting, but conversions are what matter.

Goals let you track specific outcomes - signups, purchases, downloads. Set a goal for "/thank-you" and see how many visitors actually convert, broken down by source, device, and more.

Funnels go deeper. Define a multi-step process (view product -> add to cart -> checkout -> purchase) and see exactly where users drop off. Finding a 60% drop-off at checkout? Now you know where to focus.`,

Build custom dashboards, set up alerts when traffic spikes, pipe data into your own tools, create reports for clients - the data is yours to use however you want.

Authentication is simple (API key in header), and the endpoints mirror what you see in the UI. Query pageviews, events, sessions, funnels - whatever you need.`,
