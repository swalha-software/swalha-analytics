 * Cohort-uniformity rule. A cohort is one exact device fingerprint on a site —
 * (screen, language, browser) — and the rule measures how its traffic is spread
 * across browser major versions inside a fixed one-minute bucket.
 *
 * An organic cohort is steeply peaked: browsers auto-update, so one current
 * version holds most of it (measured 0.52-0.98 modal share, and >=0.74 for every
 * cohort large enough to reach the volume gate). A fleet that rotates a fixed
 * list of user agents to mint fresh identities is flat instead — each version
 * takes an equal slice — which no real population produces. The bot that
 * motivated this rule sat at 0.09-0.15 across 16 versions.
 *
 * This is the only shape that catches a paced distributed crawler: such a
 * crawler stays under every per-identity rate threshold by design (one event per
 * several minutes per identity), so rate rules never see it, and it is invisible
 * to any single-visitor view because the evidence only exists in aggregate.
 * Thresholds are set with a wide margin — over 24h of production traffic across
 * every site, only the crawler's own cohort satisfied all three.
